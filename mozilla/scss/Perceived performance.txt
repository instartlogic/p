Perceived performance

human perception of performance

we optimize for objective time becuase it's easy to measure

just noticeable difference: something needs to be significantly different enough to be noticeable

time differences of 20% or less are imperceptable
-steve seow, Microsoft

Active phase v. passes phase
a watched pot never boils


humans tend to overestimate passive time by 36%

takes 1 sec to transform from active to passive state
make illusions to make that time go more quickly

1) don't tell users they are waiting (you're putting them into passive state)
2) respond to interaction immediately
3) 


implement active states

example: create active state for a button, while prefetching the site that will be gotten when the button has the click.


slack takes you from active state to active state to active state

weird effects can give you an extra 600ms ("fancy" button)

predictive preloading based on mouse slowing down as it gets close to the link/button

address subjective perceptions

objecctive time really doesn't matter. subjective time, how it feels, is what matters.
