website, service worker, manifest, https

service worker routes requests
make request to server normally
SW can intercept the request
cache, server, combo
progressive enhancement
https only - needed because they can see all the requests.

Free SSL - let's encrypt. CLoudflare yuck
Edge in development
Safari - long term road map




To make it fast
caching, http/2
service worker process
register, install, activate


caching
var cacheName = "pageCache"

this. addEventlisternier('install', event =>{
	event.waitUntil(caches.open(cacheNme))
		.then(function(cache){

		})
})

offline
with service workers, you can get it directly from cache

this.addEL('fetch', event => {
	if(event.request.method == 'GET' && event.request.headers.get('accept').includes (text/html)
	if x => get url
	else => get from cache

})



do network first
cache first
network then cache
cache then network
no sw - network only
